# Logo
As described, program implements popular "programming language", called Logo.
Turtle is represented by red or green dot. Colour depends on state of pen(up - red, down - green)
In the application, we can give following instructions to the turtle:
-forward - change turtle's position by 25 in the direction shown by his turn
-left - turn 90 degrees to left
-right - turn 90 degrees to right
-pen up - pick up the pen. When the pen is picked up, turtle's movement doesn't leave any trace.
-pen down - put the pen down. When the pen is down, turtle's movement draws the straight line.
-clean - remove all the lines from the panel, and return the turtle to starting position
-quit - exit the application. Program can also be closed by pressing X.
